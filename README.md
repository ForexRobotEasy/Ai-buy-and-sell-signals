# AI Buy and Sell Signals

This is a sample code for an Expert Advisor (EA) that generates buy and sell signals based on the Average True Range (ATR) algorithm. It is developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team and can be found on their website [forexroboteasy.com](https://forexroboteasy.com/).

## Installation

To use this code, you need to have the MetaTrader platform installed. Follow these steps to install the EA:

1. Copy the code and save it as a .mq4 file.
2. Open the MetaEditor in MetaTrader.
3. Click on 'File' and then 'Open File' to open the .mq4 file.
4. Click on 'Compile' to compile the code.
5. Go back to MetaTrader, open the 'Navigator' window, and find the EA under 'Expert Advisors'.
6. Drag and drop the EA onto the desired chart.

## Algorithm

This EA uses the ATR indicator to generate buy and sell signals. The ATR value is calculated using the specified time frame and period. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Set the ATR indicator parameters.
2. Enable notifications for buy and sell signals.
3. On each tick, generate buy and sell signals based on the modified ATR algorithm.
4. Execute trade operations based on the generated signals.

The modified ATR algorithm determines if the current price is above, below, or equal to the ATR value. If the price is above the ATR value, a buy signal is generated. If the price is below the ATR value, a sell signal is generated. If the price is equal to the ATR value, no signal is generated.
